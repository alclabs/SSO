<h1>Single Sign On Sample</h1>
<p>
  The SSO Add-On demonstrates the use of server operators and privileges to control access to
  your add-on.  Additionally it demonstrates linking back and forth between the server and your add-on
  while only presenting log in credentials a single time.
</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>
  Deploy the SSO sample add-on by executing the 'deploy' task and starting (if necessary) the server.
</p>
<p>
  Browse to <span class="examp">http://yourserver/sso</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/sso">open on localhost</a>).
  This should present a login page. Log in with any valid operator and password.
</p>
<p>
  You can follow the links on the bottom of the page to link into the server without re-entering your password.
  The link to the <i>protected page</i> will only work if you logged in as an operator that has the
  &quot;Access User Category 1&quot; privilege.
</p>
<h2>Important Lessons</h2>
<p>
  This web app add-on is a good example of basic security configuraiton in a <span class="examp">WEB-INF/web.xml</span> file.
  It contains two different security-constraints: one requires a valid operator for access to any page
  (by requiring the <span class="examp">login</span> role), the other requires a specific role
  (<span class="examp">view_user_category_1</span>) in order to access the /second.jsp page.
</p>
<p>
  This add-on also provides good sample login form pages in the <span class="examp">/loginout</span> directory.  Feel
  free to copy the <span class="examp">/loginout</span> directory and the <span class="examp">WEB-INF/web.xml</span> file
  as a starting point for your own Add-On.
